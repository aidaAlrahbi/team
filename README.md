Challenge 1 Dyslexia，misspelling files can make it difficult to place and locate her content. Problems only able to identify characters from shapes prone to misspelling difficult to compare words etc Hard to retrieve files Solutions use color coding for archives, design a system alongside language to help file documents not practical for thousands of files git-like comparison tool to check Fuzzy search, improve tolerance for misspelling intelligent suggestion/correction for file names etc Text to speech Converter Assess the condition of the affected child and design an educational program that meets his individual needs . App design/ learning to recognize and use the smallest sounds that make up words (phonemes) . Dropdown list of pre-set dictionary of words to choose from Visualize the process of choosing, eg enter metadate like people with photos or other pictures/audio that help dyslexia people identify the word, when hovering over a word for X seconds, there will be pop-up hints Python file renamer script, detect spelling errors based on pre-set rules (regular expression etc) and bulk rename files User scenario Correct previously misspelt filenames in bulk Load files under specified path Loop over files one by one Print a snapshot of preview of the documents/medias If need to entirely rename the file Ask input with (visual/verbal) prompt one by one eg “Type of documents?””People related?” User can navigate with ⬅➡to choose from a list of pre-set entries or voice input If only need to check spelling Run a spell checker for the filename (record the spelling error) User reject or accept the suggestion Retrieve files By search with potentially mistyped keywords -> fuzzy search By scanning through files under a filepath -> “Read Aloud” Easily name file with correct spelling (in various applications) Text expander Crowsource for a library of terminologies, phrases that tend to be misspelt Suggest files that are potentially misnamed regularly Run a stat on how many times a recently created file is used/retrieved, a file never retrieved after creation might be misnamed Match filenames with recorded typos (learning from history)
